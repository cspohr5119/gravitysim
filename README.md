Javascript n-body gravity simulation

This is just a simple html page with embedded javascript to experiment with gravity.  Multiple balls of random weights and sizes are placed on a
2d canvas and given initial random velocities.  The laws of physics take over.

When the balls bounce off of each other, it's modelled as electrostatic repulsion at the spheres' edges.

The number of balls, weights, velocities, frame rates, and more can be modified in the first few lines of Javascript code.
